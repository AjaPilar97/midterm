		</div>
		<p><span class="title">The Shining</span> mainly takes place in the fictional Overlook Hotel, an isolated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunted_house" target="_blank">haunted</a> resort hotel located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" target="_blank">Colorado</a> Rockies. The history of the hotel, which is described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory" target="_blank">backstory</a> by several characters, includes the deaths of some of its guests and of former winter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_caretaker" target="_blank">caretaker</a> Delbert Grady, who succumbed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_fever" target="_blank">cabin fever</a> and killed his family and himself.</p>
		<p>The plot centers on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Torrance" target="_blank">Jack Torrance</a>, his wife Wendy, and their five-year-old son Danny, who move into the hotel after Jack accepts the position as winter caretaker. Jack is an aspiring writer and recovering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism" target="_blank">alcoholic</a> with anger issues which, prior to the story, had caused him to accidentally break Danny's arm and lose his position as a teacher after assaulting a student. Jack hopes that the hotel's seclusion will help him reconnect with his family and give him the motivation needed to work on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)" target="_blank">play</a>. Danny, unknown to his parents, possesses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy" target="_blank">telepathic</a> abilities referred to as "the shining" that enable him to read minds and experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precognition" target="_blank">premonitions</a>. The Torrances arrive at the hotel on closing day and are given a tour by the manager. They meet Dick Hallorann, the chef, who also possesses similar abilities to Danny's and helps to explain them to him, giving Hallorann and Danny a special connection. The remaining staff and guests depart, leaving the Torrances alone in the hotel for the winter.</p>
		<p>As the Torrances settle in at the Overlook, Danny sees <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost" target="_blank">ghosts</a> and frightening visions. Although Danny is close to his parents, he does not tell either of them about his visions because he senses that the care-taking job is important to his father and the family's future. Wendy considers leaving Jack at the Overlook to finish the job by himself; Danny refuses, thinking his father will be happier if they stayed. However, Danny soon realizes that his presence in the hotel makes the supernatural activity more powerful, turning echoes of past tragedies into dangerous threats. Apparitions take solid form and the garden's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiary" target="_blank">topiary</a> animals come to life. The winter snowfall leaves the Torrances cut off from the outside world in the isolated hotel.</p>
		<p>The Overlook has difficulty possessing Danny, so it begins to possess Jack by frustrating his need and desire to work and by enticing him with the storied history of the hotel through a scrapbook and records in the basement. Jack starts to develop cabin fever and becomes increasingly unstable, destroying a CB radio and sabotaging a snowmobile, the only two links with the outside world the Torrances had. One day, after a fight with Wendy, Jack finds the hotel's bar fully stocked with liquor despite being previously empty, and witnesses a party at which he meets the ghost of a bartender named Lloyd. As he gets drunk, the hotel uses the ghost of the former caretaker Grady to urge Jack to kill his wife and son. He initially resists, but the increasing influence of the hotel combined with Jack's own alcoholism and anger prove too great. He becomes a monster under the control of the hotel, succumbing to his dark side. Wendy and Danny get the better of Jack after he attacks Wendy, locking him inside the walk-in pantry, but the ghost of Delbert Grady releases him after he makes Jack promise to bring him Danny and to kill Wendy. Jack attacks Wendy with one of the hotel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roque" target="_blank">roque</a> mallets, grievously injuring her, but she escapes to the caretaker's suite and locks herself in the bathroom. Jack attempts to break the door with the mallet, but Wendy slashes his hand with a razor blade to deter him.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Hallorann has received a psychic distress call from Danny while working at a winter resort in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" target="_blank">Florida</a>. Hallorann rushes back to the Overlook, only to be attacked by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiary" target="_blank">topiary</a> animals and severely injured by Jack. As Jack pursues Danny through the Overlook and corners him on the hotel's top floor, he briefly gains control of himself and implores Danny to run away after Danny stands his ground and denounces Jack as a mask and false face worn by the hotel. The hotel takes control of Jack again, making him violently batter his own face and skull into ruin with the mallet, destroying the last vestiges of Jack and leaving a being controlled by the hotel's own malevolent "manager" personality. Remembering that Jack has neglected to relieve the pressure on the hotel's unstable boiler, Danny informs the hotel that the boiler is about to explode. As Danny, Wendy, and Hallorann flee, the hotel-creature rushes to the basement in an attempt to vent the boiler, but it is too late and the boiler explodes, destroying the Overlook. Fighting off a last attempt by the hotel to possess him, Hallorann guides Danny and Wendy to safety.</p>
		<p>The book's epilogue is set during the next summer. Hallorann, who has taken a chef's job at a resort in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine" target="_blank">Maine</a>, comforts Danny over the loss of his father as Wendy recuperates from the injuries Jack inflicted on her.</p>

		<p>After writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(novel)" target="_blank">Carrie</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Salem%27s_Lot" target="_blank">'Salem's Lot</a>, which are both set in small towns in King's native Maine, King was looking for a change of pace for the next book. "I wanted to spend a year away from Maine so that my next novel would have a different sort of background." King opened an atlas of the US on the kitchen table and randomly pointed to a location, which turned out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado" target="_blank">Boulder, Colorado</a>.</p>
		<p>On October 30, 1974, King and his wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabitha" target="_blank">Tabitha</a> checked into The Stanley Hotel in nearby Estes Park, Colorado. They were the only two guests in the hotel that night. "When we arrived, they were just getting ready to close for the season, and we found ourselves the only guests in the place — with all those long, empty corridors". They checked into room 217 which was said to be haunted. This is where room 217 comes from in the book.</p>
		<p>Ten years earlier, King had read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" target="_blank">Ray Bradbury</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Veldt_(short_story)" target="_blank">"The Veldt"</a> and was inspired to someday write a story about a person whose dreams would become real. In 1972, King started a novel entitled Darkshine, which was to be about a psychic boy in a psychic amusement park, but the idea never came to fruition and he abandoned the book. During the night at the Stanley, this story came back to him.</p>
		<p>King and his wife had dinner that evening in the grand dining room, totally alone. They were offered one choice for dinner, the only meal still available. Taped orchestral music played in the room and theirs was the only table set for dining. "Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall, and, I mean, it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things. And by the time I went to bed that night, I had the whole book in my mind".</p>
		<p>After dinner, his wife decided to turn in, but King took a walk around the empty hotel. He ended up in the bar and was served drinks by a bartender named Grady.</p>
		<p>"That night I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of the book firmly set in my mind."</p>
		<blockquote>Sometimes you confess. You always hide what you're confessing to. That's one of the reasons why you make up the story. When I wrote The Shining, for instance, the protagonist of The Shining is a man who has broken his son's arm, who has a history of child beating, who is beaten himself. And as a young father with two children, I was horrified by my occasional feelings of real antagonism toward my children. Won't you ever stop? Won't you ever go to bed? And time has given me the idea that probably there are a lot of young fathers and young mothers both who feel very angry, who have angry feelings toward their children. But as somebody who has been raised with the idea that father knows best and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cleaver" target="_blank">Ward Cleaver</a> on '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_To_Beaver" target="_blank">Leave It To Beaver</a>,' and all this stuff, I would think to myself, Oh, if he doesn't shut up, if he doesn't shut up... So when I wrote this book I wrote a lot of that down and tried to get it out of my system, but it was also a confession. Yes, there are times when I felt very angry toward my children and have even felt as though I could hurt them. Well, my kids are older now. Naomi is fifteen and Joey is thirteen and Owen is eight, and they're all super kids, and I don't think I've laid a hand on one of my kids in probably seven years, but there was a time...</blockquote>

			<p>The story has been often compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_de_Maupassant" target="_blank">Guy de Maupassant</a>'s story "The Inn".</p>
		<p>Before writing <span class="title">The Shining</span>, King had written <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadwork" target="_blank"><span class="title">Roadwork</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_(novella)" target="_blank"><span class="title">The Body</span></a> which were both published later. The first draft of <span class="title">The Shining</span> took less than four months to complete and he was able to publish it before the others. The title was inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon" target="_blank">John Lennon</a> song "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Karma!" target="_blank">Instant Karma!</a>", which contained the line "We all shine on".</p>
		<p>Bill Thompson, King's editor at Doubleday, tried to talk him out of <span class="title">The Shining</span> because he thought that after writing <span class="title">Carrie</span> and <span class="title">'Salem's Lot</span>, he would get "typed" as a horror writer. King considered that a compliment.</p>

	<h2 id="Deleted">Deleted prologue and epilogue</h2>
		<p>Originally, there was a prologue titled "Before the Play" that chronicled earlier events in the Overlook's history, as well as an epilogue titled "After the Play", though neither remained part of the published novel.[14] The prologue was later published in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whispers_(magazine/anthologies)" target="_blank"><span class="title">Whispers</span></a> magazine in August 1982, and an abridged version appeared in the April 26–May 2, 1997 issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" target="_blank"><span class="title">TV Guide</span></a> to promote the then-upcoming miniseries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(miniseries)" target="_blank"><span class="title">The Shining</span></a>. The epilogue was thought to have been lost, but was re-discovered in 2016 as part of an early manuscript version of the novel. Both "Before the Play" and "After the Play" will be published as part of the Deluxe Special Edition of <span class="title">The Shining</span> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery_Dance_Publications" target="_blank">Cemetery Dance Publications</a> in early 2017.</p>

	<h2 id="Sequel">Sequel</h2>
		<blockquote><span class="title">Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Sleep_(novel)" target="_blank">Doctor Sleep (novel)</a></span></blockquote>
		<p>On November 19, 2009, during a reading at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Theatre" target="_blank">Canon Theatre</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto" target="_blank">Toronto</a>, King described to the audience an idea for a sequel to <span class="title">The Shining</span>. The idea was prompted by the occasional person asking, "What ever happened to Danny?"[17] The story would follow Danny Torrance, now in his 40s, living in New Hampshire, where he works as an orderly at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospice" target="_blank">hospice</a> and helps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness" target="_blank">terminally</a> ill patients pass away with the aid of some extraordinary powers.[18] Later, on December 1, 2009, King posted a poll on his official website, asking visitors to vote for which book he should write next, <span class="title">Doctor Sleep</span> or the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower:_The_Wind_Through_the_Keyhole" target="_blank">Dark Tower novel</a>:</p>
		<blockquote>I mentioned two potential projects while I was on the road, one a new Mid-World book (not directly about Roland Deschain, but yes, he and his friend Cuthbert are in it, hunting a skin-man, which are what werewolves are called in that lost kingdom) and a sequel to <span class="title">The Shining</span> called <span class="title">Doctor Sleep</span>. Are you interested in reading either of these? If so, which one turns your dials more? [We] will be counting your votes (and of course it all means nothing if the muse doesn't speak).</blockquote>
		<p>Voting ended on December 31, 2009, and it was revealed that Doctor Sleep received 5,861 votes, while <span class="title">The Wind Through the Keyhole</span> received 5,812.</p>
		<p>In 2011, King posted an update confirming that Doctor Sleep was in the works and that the plot included a traveling group of psychic vampires called The True Knot.</p>
		<p><span class="title">Doctor Sleep</span> was published on September 24, 2013.</p>
